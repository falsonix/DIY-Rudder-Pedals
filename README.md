# 'Cruiser' Rudder Pedals

DIY rudder pedals for flight simulation in programs like X-Plane, MSFS, etc. The pedals themselves are almost entirely 3D-printed, minus the fastners, bearings, and electronics. Utilizing a Raspberry Pi Pico 2 as the main microcontroller, the device is plug-and-play with most modern flight simulation softwares after the firmware is flashed. Rudder pedals are used in real planes to control the aircraft's yaw while in flight, and is often times used to control the nose gear on the ground in a flight simulator. Having a controller that can interface with the computer intuitively can provide a much more realistic experience, and can make the task of flying more enjoyable.

I made this project mostly because flight simming is a big hobby of mine, and I've been wanting a set of rudder pedals for quite some time now. I hope that by designing this hardware I can get more people into flight simulation as a whole, and improve the experience of those who are already interested in it.
