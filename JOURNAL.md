Today marks the beginning of this project. I wanted to create something that I'd actually use more than once, and wanted to tie it into my current obsession with virtual planes. I began with researching what types of pedals are available for purchase, and what common design features they share. A few things that I noticed were similar on several models are:
- Flat or slightly curved pedals to easily grip the feet
- Raised walls on the sides/back of the pedals to prevent the feet from slipping off of the pedals
- Mechanism (that kind of reminds me of the steering thing on the front wheels of a car) that allows the pedals to shift forward and backward according to user input, while keeping the input inverted between pedals
- A relatively small base footprint, which does help keep the underneath of your desk uncrowded
